        College students consume surprising quantities of caffeine on average.  
        This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school.
    The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the national daily average (Group B),
and a control group which receive a placebbo (Group C).
Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term.  
A higher than average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester.
Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.

       <h2>Steps to Reproduce:</h2>
       <!--The Steps to Reproduce are meant to be displayed in an ordered list.
    -->
       <p>
           <ol>
               <li>100 students were sleected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3.</li>
               <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100.</li>
               <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C.</li>
               <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average).</li>
               <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day.</li>
               <li>Group C was given a placebo.</li>
               <li>Grade point averages were tracked throught the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted.</li>
